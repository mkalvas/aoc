# NaÃ¯ve DFS

Works, but too slow for whole thing. Key insight to optimize away the search is to just find the number of items in the list that is smaller than `[[2]]` and `[[6]]`, then we account for indexing `twoIndex + 1` and `sixIndex + 2` (one for the extra missing `[[2]]` element (that we could have just added and only been off by one, but that's technically slower) and the other for the `0` indexing).

```js
const setOrder = (root, packets) => {
  if (packets.length === 0) return [root];
  for (let i = 0; i < packets.length; i++) {
    const [left, right] = [structuredClone(root), structuredClone(packets[i])];
    if (isOrdered(left, right)) {
      const stack = [root, ...setOrder(packets[i], cut(packets, i))];
      if (stack.length === packets.length + 1) return stack;
    }
  }
  return [];
};

export const solutionTwo = (input) => {
  const packets = [...input, '[[2]]', '[[6]]'].filter(Boolean).map(eval);
  const root = packets.map((p) => p.length).indexOf(0);
  const stack = setOrder(packets[root], cut(packets, root)).map(JSON.stringify);
  return (stack.indexOf('[[2]]') + 1) * (stack.indexOf('[[6]]') + 1);
};
```
