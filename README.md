# Advent of Code

This is a small repo for coding and testing solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

## [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

This year I decided to write in JS because I know it well and I wanted to try and stick with it. I'm guessing that using a familiar language will cut down on the time it takes to solve each day and remove the frustrating gap between knowing the solution but not getting it to work right because of my ignorance of a new language. Both of those should give me a better shot at actually completing this year.

I also decided to write up my thought process and solution explanations on my blog. Here's [a link to the index post](https://blog.mkalvas.com/posts/aoc-2020) that links out to all the other solutions. You'll need to go through that page to find the individual posts because I didn't want them cluttering up the main blog page.

```sh
# Install deps
npm install

# Run build in watch mode
npm run build:watch

# Run tests
npm run test:watch

# Hack

# Run all puzzles and see the solution output
npm start
```
