# Advent of Code

This is a small repo for coding and testing solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

## [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

This year I decided to write in JS because I know it well and I wanted to try and solve the puzzles as fast as possible. I deliberately went with first gut solutions and didn't try to make things fast, elegant, or generalizable.

This is not an example of good code and besides the solution code itself there's lots of random junk around printing and testing that could be cleaned up.

```sh
# Install deps
npm install

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run all puzzles and see the solution output
npm start
```
